            <h4>Analysis of Website</h4>
            <p>My name is Kyi Thant!  For this assignment, I'm checking out the look and feel (UX) of the mobile websites for 3 of the biggest smartphone brands.  I'm going to use cool features in CSS option, and flexbox option to make the layout bend and adjust.  To make the websites look fancy, I'll use things like see-through colors, smooth color blends, and special commands to pick out specific parts of the website.  I'll also add shadows to text and boxes for a 3D effect, and use filters to make things look even cooler.  Finally, I'll make sure the websites work well on all phone sizes by using media queries.</p>
