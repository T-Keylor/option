        <h2>GOOGLE Pixel</h2>
        <p>Google Pixel is a brand of smartphones designed and marketed by Google LLC, which is a subsidiary of Alphabet Inc. Alphabet Inc. has a complex corporate structure with a board of directors and Sundar Pichai as the CEO. Before Google called its smartphone line the Pixel, Google smartphones were actually called the Nexus series. They were initially designed for developers. Eventually Google decided to make its smartphone more accessible, adding a premium phone to the Android experience and, in 2016, the Google Pixel phone was born.</p>

            <h4>Analysis of Website</h4>
            <p>My name is Kyi Thant!  For this assignment, I'm checking out the look and feel (UX) of the mobile websites for 3 of the biggest smartphone brands.  I'm going to use cool features in CSS option, and flexbox option to make the layout bend and adjust.  To make the websites look fancy, I'll use things like see-through colors, smooth color blends, and special commands to pick out specific parts of the website.  I'll also add shadows to text and boxes for a 3D effect, and use filters to make things look even cooler.  Finally, I'll make sure the websites work well on all phone sizes by using media queries.</p>
